 ### Challenge 2: Named Coordinate
 Create a constant called `namedCoordinate` with a `row` and `column` component of 2 and 3.

 ### Challenge 3: Which are Valid?
 Which of the following are valid statements?
*/
//let character: Character = "Dog" // INVALID
//let character: Character = "üê∂" // VALID
//let string: String = "Dog" // VALID
//let string: String = "üê∂" // VALID

 ### Challenge 4. Does it Compile?
 Is this valid code?
*/
let tuple = (day: 15, month: 8, year: 2015)

/*:
 ### Challenge 5: Find the Error
 What is wrong with the following code?
*/
let name = "Matt"
//name += " Galloway" // 'name' is a constant, so you can't change its value

/*:
 ### Challenge 6: What is the Type of `value`?
 What is the type of the constant called `value`?
 */
let value = tuple.1 // value = 8 of type Double

/*:
 ### Challenge 7: What is the Value of `month`?
 What is the value of the constant called `month`?
*/

 ### Challenge 8: What is the Value of `summary`?
 What is the value of the constant called `summary`?

  What is the sum of `a` and `b`, minus `c`?
 */

 ### Challenge 10: Different Precision ùúãs
 What is the difference between `Double.pi` and `Float.pi`?
 */
let difference = Double.pi - Double(Float.pi)

// Float is a little less accurate so it makes sense to promote it to
// a Double. Double is more accurate but it is not exact! That 
// would require an infinite number of bits. :]
