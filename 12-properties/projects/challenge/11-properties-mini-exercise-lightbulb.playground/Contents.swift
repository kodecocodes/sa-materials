 ## Properties Mini-exercise, Lightbulb
 In the light bulb example, the bulb goes back to a successful setting if the current gets too high. In real life, that wouldn’t work. The bulb would burn out!

 Your task is to rewrite the structure so that the bulb turns off before the current burns it out.

 Hint: You’ll need to use the `willSet` observer that gets called before value is changed. The value that is about to be set is available in the constant `newValue`. The trick is that you can’t change this `newValue`, and it will still be set, so you’ll have to go beyond adding a `willSet` observer. :]

struct LightBulb {
  static let maxCurrent = 40
  var isOn = false
  var current = LightBulb.maxCurrent {
    willSet { // can observe the newValue, but can't change it
      if newValue > Self.maxCurrent {
        print("Current is too high, turning off to prevent burn out.")
        isOn = false
      }
    }
    didSet {
      if current > Self.maxCurrent {
        print("Current is too high, falling back to previous setting.")
        current = oldValue
      }
    }
  }
}

// Installing a new bulb
var bulb = LightBulb() // Light bulb is off

// Flipping the switch
bulb.isOn = true // Light bulb is ON with 40 amps

// Using the dimmer
bulb.current = 30 // Light bulb is ON with 30 amps

// Using the dimmer to a high value
bulb.current = 50 // Light bulb is OFF

// Flipping the switch
bulb.isOn = true // Light bulb is ON with 30 amps
