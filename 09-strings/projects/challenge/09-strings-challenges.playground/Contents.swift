/*:
 ### Challenge 1: Character Count
 Write a function that takes a string and prints out the count of each character in the string.
 
 For bonus points, print them ordered by the count of each character.
 
 For bonus-bonus points, print it as a nice histogram.
 
 Hint: You could use # characters to draw the bars.
 */

/*:
 ### Challenge 2: Word Count
 Write a function that tells you how many words there are in a string. Do it without splitting the string.
 
 Hint: try iterating through the string yourself.
 */

  if inWord {
    count += 1
  }

print(wordCount)


/*:
 ### Challenge 3: Name Formatter
Write a function that takes a string which looks like "Galloway, Matt" and returns one which looks like "Matt Galloway", i.e., the string goes from `"<LAST_NAME>, <FIRST_NAME>"` to `"<FIRST_NAME> <LAST_NAME>"`.

/*:
 ### Challenge 4: Components

 A method exists on a string named `components(separatedBy:)` that will split the string into chunks, which are delimited by the given string, and return an array containing the results.
 
 Your challenge is to implement this yourself.
 
 Hint: There exists a view on `String` named `indices` that lets you iterate through all the indices (of type `String.Index`) in the string. You will need to use this.

      lastWordIndex = string.index(after: i)

/*:
 ### Challenge 5: Word Reverser
 Write a function which takes a string and returns a version of it with each individual word reversed.
 
 For example, if the string is “My dog is called Rover” then the resulting string would be "yM god si dellac revoR".
 
 Try to do it by iterating through the `indices` of the string until you find a space, and then reversing what was before it. Build up the result string by continually doing that as you iterate through the string.
 
 Hint: You’ll need to do a similar thing as you did for Challenge 4 but reverse the word each time. Try to explain to yourself, or the closest unsuspecting family member, why this is better in terms of memory usage than using the function you created in the previous challenge.

  var lastWordIndex = sentence.startIndex

      reversedWords += substring.reversed() + " "
      lastWordIndex = sentence.index(after: i)
