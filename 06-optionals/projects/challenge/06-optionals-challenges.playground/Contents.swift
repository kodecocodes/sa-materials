 ## Optionals
 
 ### Challenge 1: You Be the Compiler
 Which of the following are valid statements?
 
 ```swift
 var name: String? = "Ray"
 var age: Int = nil
 let distance: Float = 26.7
 var middleName: String? = nil
 ```
*/
var name: String? = "Ray"
//var age: Int = nil // Invalid: nil can only be used with optional types
let distance: Float = 26.7
var middleName: String? = nil
/*:
 ### Challenge 2: Divide and Conquer
 
 First, create a function that returns the number of times an integer can be divided by another integer without a remainder. The function should return `nil` if the division doesn’t produce a whole number. Name the function `divideIfWhole`.
 
 Then, write code that tries to unwrap the optional result of the function. There should be two cases: upon success, print `"Yep, it divides \(answer) times"`, and upon failure, print `"Not divisible :["`.
 
 Finally, test your function:
 
 1. Divide 10 by 2. This should print `"Yep, it divides 5 times."`
 2. Divide 10 by 3. This should print `"Not divisible :[."`
 
 **Hint 1**: Use the following as the start of the function signature:
 
 ```swift
 func divideIfWhole(_ value: Int, by divisor: Int)
 ```
 
 You’ll need to add the return type, which will be an optional!
 
 **Hint 2**: You can use the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if a value is divisible by another; recall that this operation returns the remainder from the division of two numbers. For example, `10 % 2 = 0` means that 10 is divisible by 2 with no remainder, whereas `10 % 3 = 1` means that 10 is divisible by 3 with a remainder of 1.
*/
func divideIfWhole(_ value: Int, by divisor: Int) -> Int? {
  if value % divisor == 0 {
    return value / divisor
  } else {
    return nil
  }
}

if let answer = divideIfWhole(10, by: 2) {
  print("Yep, it divides \(answer) times.")
} else {
  print("Not divisible :[.")
}

if let answer = divideIfWhole(10, by: 3) {
  print("Yep, it divides \(answer) times.")
} else {
  print("Not divisible :[.")
}
/*:
 ### Challenge 3: Refactor and Reduce
 
 The code you wrote in the last challenge used `if` statements. In this challenge, refactor that code to use nil coalescing instead. This time, make it print `"It divides X times"` in all cases, but if the division doesn’t result in a whole number, then `X` should be `0`.
 */
let answer1 = divideIfWhole(10, by: 2) ?? 0
print("It divides \(answer1) times.")

let answer2 = divideIfWhole(10, by: 3) ?? 0
print("It divides \(answer2) times.")
/*:
 ### Challenge 4: Nested Optionals
 
 Consider the following nested optional. It corresponds to a number inside a box inside a box inside a box.
 
 ```swift
 let number: Int??? = 10
 ```
 
 If you print number you get the following:
 
 ```swift
 print(number)
 // Optional(Optional(Optional(10)))
 
 print(number!)
 // Optional(Optional(10))
 ```
 
 1. Fully force unwrap and print `number`.
 2. Optionally bind and print `number` with if let.
 3. Write a function `printNumber(_ number: Int???)` that uses `guard` to print the number only if it is bound.
 */
let number: Int??? = 10

// 1
print(number!!!)

// 2
if let number = number {
  if let number = number {
    if let number = number {
      print(number)
    }
  }
}

// Better way of optionally binding without all the {}
if let n1 = number,
   let n2 = n1,
   let n3 = n2 {
  print(n3)
}

// 3
func printNumber(_ number: Int???) {
  guard let n1 = number, let n2 = n1, let n3 = n2 else {
    return
  }
  print(n3)
}
printNumber(number)
