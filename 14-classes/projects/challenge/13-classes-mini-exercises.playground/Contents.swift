// Write a function `memberOf(person: Person, group: [Person]) -> Bool` that will return `true` if `person` can be found inside `group`, and `false` if it is not. Test it by creating two arrays of five `Person` objects for `group` and using `john` as the `person`. Put `john` in one of the arrays, but not in the other.

  group.contains(where: { $0 === person })

// Write a method on `Student` that returns the studentâ€™s Grade Point Average, or "GPA". A GPA is defined as the number of points earned divided by the number of credits taken. For the example above Jane earned (9 + 16 = 25) points while taking (3 + 4 = 7) credits, making her GPA (25 / 7 = 3.57). Points in most American universities range from 4 per credit for an A, down to 1 point for a D (with an F being 0 points). For this exercise, you may of course use any scale that you want!

  let points: Double
