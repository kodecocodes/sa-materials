 ## Basic Control Flow
 ### Challenge 1: Find the error
 Whatâ€™s wrong with the following code?
 
 ```
 let firstName = "Matt"
 
 if firstName == "Matt" {
   let lastName = "Galloway"
 } else if firstName == "Ray" {
   let lastName = "Wenderlich"
 }
 let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
 ```
 */
// `lastName` is no longer in scope when setting `fullName`.
// A correct solution:
let firstName = "Matt"
var lastName = ""

if firstName == "Matt" {
  lastName = "Galloway"
} else if firstName == "Ray" {
  lastName = "Wenderlich"
}

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

 ### Challenge 2: Boolean challenge
 In each of the following statements, what is the value of the Boolean `answer` constant?
 */

let answer1 = true && true
// true

let answer2 = false || false

/*:
 ### Challenge 3: Snakes and ladders
 Imagine you're playing a game of snakes & ladders that goes from position 1 to position 20. On it, there are ladders at position 3 and 7 which take you to 15 and 12 respectively. Then there are snakes at positions 11 and 17 which take you to 2 and 9 respectively.

 Create a constant called `currentPosition` which you can set to whatever position between 1 and 20 which you like. Then create a constant called `diceRoll` which you can set to whatever roll of the dice you want. Finally, calculate the final position taking into account the ladders and snakes, calling it `nextPosition`.

 ### Challenge 4: Number of days in a month
 Given a year reprsented by an `Int` and a month represented by a `String` in all lowercase and using the first three letters, calculate the number of days in the month.

A leap year occurs every 4 years, unless the year is divisible by 100, but then if it's divisible by 400 then it is actually a leap year.
