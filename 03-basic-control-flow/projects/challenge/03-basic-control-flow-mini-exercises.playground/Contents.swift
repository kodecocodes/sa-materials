/*: 
 ### BOOLEAN LOGIC
 Create a constant called `myAge` and set it to your age. Then, create a constant called `isTeenager` that uses Boolean logic to determine if the age denotes someone in the age range of 13 to 19.
 */
let myAge = 30
let isTeenager = myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19

/*:
 Create another constant called `theirAge` and set it to age 30. Then, create a constant called `bothTeenagers` that uses Boolean logic to determine if both ages denote teenagers.
 */

/*:
 Create a constant called reader and set it to your name as a `String`. Create a constant called author and set it to my name, Matt Galloway. Create a constant called `authorIsReader` that uses string equality to determine if reader and author are equal.

/*:
 Create a constant called `readerBeforeAuthor` which uses string comparison to determine if reader comes before author.

/*:
 ### IF STATEMENTS
 Create a constant called `myAge` and initialize it with your age. Write an `if` statement to print out "Teenager" if your age is between 13 and 19, and "Not a teenager" if your age is not between 13 and 19.

 ### WHILE LOOPS
 Create a variable named `counter` and set it equal to 0. Create a `while` loop with the condition `counter < 10` which prints out "counter is X" (where `X` is replaced with counter value) and then increments `counter` by 1.

 Create a variable named counter and set it equal to 0. Create another variable named roll and set it equal to 0. Create a repeat-while loop. Inside the loop, set roll equal to `Int.random(in: 1...6)` which means to pick a random integer between 1 and 6. Then increment counter by 1. Finally, print "After X rolls, roll is Y" where X is the value of counter and Y is the value of roll. Set the loop condition such that the loop finishes when the first 0 is rolled.
